# My_Hunter ðŸ¦†

My_Hunter is an Epitech project inspired by Duck Hunt, where players aim and shoot at ducks flying across the screen, recreating the classic hunting experience with simple controls and engaging graphics.

## My One Piece
I created a remix within the world of One Piece, featuring three distinct worlds, each with its own unique challenges and a final boss encounter.

The goal of the game is to complete each world as quickly as possible, defeating all challenges and ultimately conquering the final boss encounter
